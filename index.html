  	<p class="blocktext">Hi, I'm Hannah. My passion for good stories and writing led me to Northwestern University, where I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Journalism.  Health and science stories are what I like to read as well as write.  Coding and webdesign are new skills that I'd never thought I'd have.  You're looking at the first of many coding projects to come. 
  	   
  	   I'm a Los Angeles native, who prefers Northern California after my time at UC Berkeley.  The Chicago area is only the beginning of my eastward move away from CA.  Asking questions about everything is a penchant of mine. Being a journalist allows me to ask away and learn new things everyday.</p>
